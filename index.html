<h1>The Bronx is the Most Rent Burdened Borough</h1>
<h3>by Sarah Kerson</h3>

<p>Fifty-seven percent of Bronx tenants spend more than 30% of their income on rent, according to data from the 2019 American Community Survey. <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr_edge_featd_article_092214.html"> The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development </a> defines rent burden as those who spend more than 30% of their income on rent. Manhattan is the least rent burdened borough at 43%, followed by Staten Island at 48%. Brooklyn and Queens both have a rent burden rate of 51%. This follows data analyzed by the U.S. Federal Reserve that showed that lowest-income families across the country face the most severe rent burdens, as the Bronx has the <a href="https://furmancenter.org/neighborhoods/view/the-bronx"> lowest median income</a> per household of any borough. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, too, has found that the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-427.pdf"> poorest households</a> face challenges in housing affordability and quality. Research by Pew also found that rent burdens <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2018/04/american-families-face-a-growing-rent-burden"> can impede homeownership.</a> In January of 2020, the New York City Department of Housing and Transportation released <a href="https://wherewelive.cityofnewyork.us/"> Where We Live NYC,</a> a report detailing the city's goals towards affordable and equitable housing. The report states that city wide, the share of tenants that are rent burdened is at the highest level on record, with more than half of New York renters spending 30% or more of their income on rent.
